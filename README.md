2. Then change to the project directory: ```cd my-reads-react```
3. Next install dependencies: ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```
4. Run the app: ```npm run start``` or ```yarn start```
5. You can add books by clicking the green "+" icon at the bottom of the page.
6. Have fun adding and sorting books.

## Note: Search Terms
